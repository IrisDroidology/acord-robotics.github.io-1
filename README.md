# AC0/RD

ACORD Robotics is a software, scientific engineering and writing organisation that is based and was founded in Australia by Nicholas Antipas \(COO\) & Liam Arbuckle \(Chairman\), originally under the name Alliance of Droids. We create and contribute to open-source software that is used in scientific projects like the Open Source Rover by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
